"#HomeDashboard" 

This is work in progress. 

The finished project will display a dashboard on multiple monitors throughout our home that will display various useful information. This will take the place of poster boards, corkboards, and signs that we currently have up. 

Features to be added:
Chore Chart
Meal Plan
Google Calendar 

Currently this app references a private database, and needs a connections string in the HomeDashboardQueries/App.config file.
